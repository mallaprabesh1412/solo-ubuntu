âš¡ So bro â†’ you just need to **create a repo on GitHub**, upload these two files (`setup.sh` + `README.md`).  
After that, users only run:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/solo-ubuntu.git
cd solo-ubuntu
bash setup.sh
````

ðŸ‘‰ and they get **SOLO Ubuntu**, with their **own username + password + VNC password**, running on **localhost:1**.

Do you want me to also include a **lightweight Android Studio installer** in this script, or keep it smooth for low-end devices (just Ubuntu + LXDE + Firefox + VS Code)?
